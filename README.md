# SugarBUDDY
SugarBUDDY is a diabetes support application designed to simplify the initiation of multiple 
insulin injections. It helps users calculate the correct insulin doses for each meal by 
utilizing open data from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare's (THL) Fineli 
carbohydrate handbook, combined with personalized medical insulin sensitivity factors. 
The app makes it easier for individuals to manage their diabetes by accurately determining insulin 
requirements based on real-time information, automating meal-specific calculations.
